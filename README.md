## Abstract

Microprofile is a new platform definition that optimizes Enterprise Java for a microservices architecture and delivers application portability across multiple runtimes. You can use a subset of the Java EE spec to develop Microprofile applications, with JAX-RS, CDI and JSON-P. Now you need to make it highly available and scalable across a large number of machines. The session will feature a live coding demo where we will turn this Microprofile application, into a fully clustered application using a CDI extension and producers to integrate Hazelcast as a JCache provider. Finally, to show you how light it is, we will run the entire cluster in a set up of Raspberry PI's.
